          <section id=modeapi>
              <h2>自定义Mode</h2>

              <p>Modes typically consist of a single JavaScript file. This file
              defines, in the simplest case, a lexer (tokenizer) for your
              language—a function that takes a character stream as input,
              advances it past a token, and returns a style for that token. More
              advanced modes can also handle indentation for the language.</p>

              <p>This section describes the low-level mode interface. Many modes
              are written directly against this, since it offers a lot of
              control, but for a quick mode definition, you might want to use
              the <a href="../demo/simplemode.html">simple mode addon</a>.</p>

              <p id="defineMode">The mode script should
              call <code><strong>CodeMirror.defineMode</strong></code> to
              register itself with CodeMirror. This function takes two
              arguments. The first should be the name of the mode, for which you
              should use a lowercase string, preferably one that is also the
              name of the files that define the mode (i.e. <code>"xml"</code> is
              defined in <code>xml.js</code>). The second argument should be a
              function that, given a CodeMirror configuration object (the thing
              passed to the <code>CodeMirror</code> function) and an optional
              mode configuration object (as in
              the <a href="#option_mode"><code>mode</code></a> option), returns
              a mode object.</p>

              <p>Typically, you should use this second argument
              to <code>defineMode</code> as your module scope function (modes
              should not leak anything into the global scope!), i.e. write your
              whole mode inside this function.</p>

              <p>The main responsibility of a mode script is <em>parsing</em>
              the content of the editor. Depending on the language and the
              amount of functionality desired, this can be done in really easy
              or extremely complicated ways. Some parsers can be stateless,
              meaning that they look at one element (<em>token</em>) of the code
              at a time, with no memory of what came before. Most, however, will
              need to remember something. This is done by using a <em>state
              object</em>, which is an object that is always passed when
              reading a token, and which can be mutated by the tokenizer.</p>

              <p id="startState">Modes that use a state must define
              a <code><strong>startState</strong></code> method on their mode
              object. This is a function of no arguments that produces a state
              object to be used at the start of a document.</p>

              <p id="token">The most important part of a mode object is
              its <code><strong>token</strong>(stream, state)</code> method. All
              modes must define this method. It should read one token from the
              stream it is given as an argument, optionally update its state,
              and return a style string, or <code>null</code> for tokens that do
              not have to be styled. For your styles, you are encouraged to use
              the 'standard' names defined in the themes (without
              the <code>cm-</code> prefix). If that fails, it is also possible
              to come up with your own and write your own CSS theme file.<p>

              <p id="token_style_line">A typical token string would
              be <code>"variable"</code> or <code>"comment"</code>. Multiple
              styles can be returned (separated by spaces), for
              example <code>"string error"</code> for a thing that looks like a
              string but is invalid somehow (say, missing its closing quote).
              When a style is prefixed by <code>"line-"</code>
              or <code>"line-background-"</code>, the style will be applied to
              the whole line, analogous to what
              the <a href="#addLineClass"><code>addLineClass</code></a> method
              does—styling the <code>"text"</code> in the simple case, and
              the <code>"background"</code> element
              when <code>"line-background-"</code> is prefixed.</p>

              <p id="StringStream">The stream object that's passed
              to <code>token</code> encapsulates a line of code (tokens may
              never span lines) and our current position in that line. It has
              the following API:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt><code><strong>eol</strong>() → boolean</code></dt>
                <dd>Returns true only if the stream is at the end of the
                line.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>sol</strong>() → boolean</code></dt>
                <dd>Returns true only if the stream is at the start of the
                line.</dd>

                <dt><code><strong>peek</strong>() → string</code></dt>
                <dd>Returns the next character in the stream without advancing
                it. Will return a <code>null</code> at the end of the
                line.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>next</strong>() → string</code></dt>
                <dd>Returns the next character in the stream and advances it.
                Also returns <code>null</code> when no more characters are
                available.</dd>

                <dt><code><strong>eat</strong>(match: string|regexp|function(char: string) → boolean) → string</code></dt>
                <dd><code>match</code> can be a character, a regular expression,
                or a function that takes a character and returns a boolean. If
                the next character in the stream 'matches' the given argument,
                it is consumed and returned. Otherwise, <code>undefined</code>
                is returned.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>eatWhile</strong>(match: string|regexp|function(char: string) → boolean) → boolean</code></dt>
                <dd>Repeatedly calls <code>eat</code> with the given argument,
                until it fails. Returns true if any characters were eaten.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>eatSpace</strong>() → boolean</code></dt>
                <dd>Shortcut for <code>eatWhile</code> when matching
                white-space.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>skipToEnd</strong>()</code></dt>
                <dd>Moves the position to the end of the line.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>skipTo</strong>(str: string) → boolean</code></dt>
                <dd>Skips to the start of the next occurrence of the given string, if
                found on the current line (doesn't advance the stream if the
                string does not occur on the line). Returns true if the
                string was found.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>match</strong>(pattern: string, ?consume: boolean, ?caseFold: boolean) → boolean</code></dt>
                <dt><code><strong>match</strong>(pattern: regexp, ?consume: boolean) → array&lt;string&gt;</code></dt>
                <dd>Act like a
                multi-character <code>eat</code>—if <code>consume</code> is true
                or not given—or a look-ahead that doesn't update the stream
                position—if it is false. <code>pattern</code> can be either a
                string or a regular expression starting with <code>^</code>.
                When it is a string, <code>caseFold</code> can be set to true to
                make the match case-insensitive. When successfully matching a
                regular expression, the returned value will be the array
                returned by <code>match</code>, in case you need to extract
                matched groups.</dd>

                <dt><code><strong>backUp</strong>(n: integer)</code></dt>
                <dd>Backs up the stream <code>n</code> characters. Backing it up
                further than the start of the current token will cause things to
                break, so be careful.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>column</strong>() → integer</code></dt>
                <dd>Returns the column (taking into account tabs) at which the
                current token starts.</dd>
                <dt><code><strong>indentation</strong>() → integer</code></dt>
                <dd>Tells you how far the current line has been indented, in
                spaces. Corrects for tab characters.</dd>

                <dt><code><strong>current</strong>() → string</code></dt>
                <dd>Get the string between the start of the current token and
                the current stream position.</dd>

                <dt><code><strong>lookAhead</strong>(n: number) → ?string</code></dt>
                <dd>Get the line <code>n</code> (&gt;0) lines after the current
                one, in order to scan ahead across line boundaries. Note that
                you want to do this carefully, since looking far ahead will make
                mode state caching much less effective.</dd>

                <dt id="baseToken"><code><strong>baseToken</strong>() → ?{type: ?string, size: number}</code></dt>
                <dd>Modes added
                through <a href="#addOverlay"><code>addOverlay</code></a>
                (and <em>only</em> such modes) can use this method to inspect
                the current token produced by the underlying mode.</dd>
              </dl>

              <p id="blankLine">By default, blank lines are simply skipped when
              tokenizing a document. For languages that have significant blank
              lines, you can define
              a <code><strong>blankLine</strong>(state)</code> method on your
              mode that will get called whenever a blank line is passed over, so
              that it can update the parser state.</p>

              <p id="copyState">Because state object are mutated, and CodeMirror
              needs to keep valid versions of a state around so that it can
              restart a parse at any line, copies must be made of state objects.
              The default algorithm used is that a new state object is created,
              which gets all the properties of the old object. Any properties
              which hold arrays get a copy of these arrays (since arrays tend to
              be used as mutable stacks). When this is not correct, for example
              because a mode mutates non-array properties of its state object, a
              mode object should define
              a <code><strong>copyState</strong></code> method, which is given a
              state and should return a safe copy of that state.</p>

              <p id="indent">If you want your mode to provide smart indentation
              (through the <a href="#indentLine"><code>indentLine</code></a>
              method and the <code>indentAuto</code>
              and <code>newlineAndIndent</code> commands, to which keys can be
              <a href="#option_extraKeys">bound</a>), you must define
              an <code><strong>indent</strong>(state, textAfter)</code> method
              on your mode object.</p>

              <p>The indentation method should inspect the given state object,
              and optionally the <code>textAfter</code> string, which contains
              the text on the line that is being indented, and return an
              integer, the amount of spaces to indent. It should usually take
              the <a href="#option_indentUnit"><code>indentUnit</code></a>
              option into account. An indentation method may
              return <code>CodeMirror.Pass</code> to indicate that it
              could not come up with a precise indentation.</p>

              <p id="mode_comment">To work well with
              the <a href="#addon_comment">commenting addon</a>, a mode may
              define <code><strong>lineComment</strong></code> (string that
              starts a line
              comment), <code><strong>blockCommentStart</strong></code>, <code><strong>blockCommentEnd</strong></code>
              (strings that start and end block comments),
              and <code>blockCommentLead</code> (a string to put at the start of
              continued lines in a block comment). All of these are
              optional.</p>

              <p id="electricChars">Finally, a mode may define either
              an <code>electricChars</code> or an <code>electricInput</code>
              property, which are used to automatically reindent the line when
              certain patterns are typed and
              the <a href="#option_electricChars"><code>electricChars</code></a>
              option is enabled. <code>electricChars</code> may be a string, and
              will trigger a reindent whenever one of the characters in that
              string are typed. Often, it is more appropriate to
              use <code>electricInput</code>, which should hold a regular
              expression, and will trigger indentation when the part of the
              line <em>before</em> the cursor matches the expression. It should
              usually end with a <code>$</code> character, so that it only
              matches when the indentation-changing pattern was just typed, not when something was
              typed after the pattern.</p>

              <p>So, to summarize, a mode <em>must</em> provide
              a <code>token</code> method, and it <em>may</em>
              provide <code>startState</code>, <code>copyState</code>,
              and <code>indent</code> methods. For an example of a trivial mode,
              see the <a href="../mode/diff/diff.js">diff mode</a>, for a more
              involved example, see the <a href="../mode/clike/clike.js">C-like
              mode</a>.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, it is useful for modes to <em>nest</em>—to have one
              mode delegate work to another mode. An example of this kind of
              mode is the <a href="../mode/htmlmixed/htmlmixed.js">mixed-mode HTML
              mode</a>. To implement such nesting, it is usually necessary to
              create mode objects and copy states yourself. To create a mode
              object, there are <code>CodeMirror.getMode(options,
              parserConfig)</code>, where the first argument is a configuration
              object as passed to the mode constructor function, and the second
              argument is a mode specification as in
              the <a href="#option_mode"><code>mode</code></a> option. To copy a
              state object, call <code>CodeMirror.copyState(mode, state)</code>,
              where <code>mode</code> is the mode that created the given
              state.</p>

              <p id="innerMode">In a nested mode, it is recommended to add an
              extra method, <code><strong>innerMode</strong></code> which, given
              a state object, returns a <code>{state, mode}</code> object with
              the inner mode and its state for the current position. These are
              used by utility scripts such as the <a href="#addon_closetag">tag
              closer</a> to get context information. Use
              the <code>CodeMirror.innerMode</code> helper function to, starting
              from a mode and a state, recursively walk down to the innermost
              mode and state.</p>

              <p>To make indentation work properly in a nested parser, it is
              advisable to give the <code>startState</code> method of modes that
              are intended to be nested an optional argument that provides the
              base indentation for the block of code. The JavaScript and CSS
              parser do this, for example, to allow JavaScript and CSS code
              inside the mixed-mode HTML mode to be properly indented.</p>

              <p id="defineMIME">It is possible, and encouraged, to associate
              your mode, or a certain configuration of your mode, with
              a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME">MIME</a> type. For
              example, the JavaScript mode associates itself
              with <code>text/javascript</code>, and its JSON variant
              with <code>application/json</code>. To do this,
              call <code><strong>CodeMirror.defineMIME</strong>(mime,
              modeSpec)</code>, where <code>modeSpec</code> can be a string or
              object specifying a mode, as in
              the <a href="#option_mode"><code>mode</code></a> option.</p>

              <p>If a mode specification wants to add some properties to the
              resulting mode object, typically for use
              with <a href="#getHelpers"><code>getHelpers</code></a>, it may
              contain a <code>modeProps</code> property, which holds an object.
              This object's properties will be copied to the actual mode
              object.</p>

              <p id="extendMode">Sometimes, it is useful to add or override mode
              object properties from external code.
              The <code><strong>CodeMirror.extendMode</strong></code> function
              can be used to add properties to mode objects produced for a
              specific mode. Its first argument is the name of the mode, its
              second an object that specifies the properties that should be
              added. This is mostly useful to add utilities that can later be
              looked up through <a href="#getMode"><code>getMode</code></a>.</p>
